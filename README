This lab is based on Java. Wrote by Yifan Zhang.

[Instruction]

*****DPLL Algorithm
Compile example: 
    javac solver.java
    java solver -v -mode dpll inputFileName.txt

1. To select DPLL mode, type "dpll" after "-mode".
2. [-v] is optional. If you want a full detail about how DPLL choose easy and hard case, type "-v" before "-mode". 
3. Input file should be the last argument as lab2 requirement indicated. 


*****BNF TO CNF 
Compile example: 
    javac solver.java
    java solver -v -mode cnf bnf.txt

1. To select CNF mode, type "cnf" after "-mode".

*****Solver
Compile example: 
    javac solver.java
    java solver -v -mode solver bnf.txt

1. To select solver mode, type "solver" after "-mode".
2. The output will give step by step.
3. The output is possible to be different than instructor's answer since a different choice for hard case of DPLL.
   I'm using "choose the first unbound atom in the HashTable" for the Guess Selection.
